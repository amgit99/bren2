The author is a renowned psychotherapist, but more importantly a holocaust survivor, he saw his father, mother, brother and wife sent to gas ovens at Auschwitz. His entire family besides himself and his sister perished. If there is anyone that could help find meaning in life, I feel it is him.

##### Preface
Hunger, humiliation, fear and deep anger at injustice are rendered tolerable by closely guarded images of beloved people, by religion, by a grim sense of humor, even by the beauties of nature - a tree or a sunset. But they aren't enough unless they help the prisoner make large sense out of senseless suffering.

*==To live is to suffer, to survive is to find meaning in the suffering. If there is a purpose in life at all, there must be a purpose in suffering and dying.==*
