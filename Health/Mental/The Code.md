I am starting this project with the optimism to come up with a framework to control my mind. I have made millions of these, from time tables to big posters to Digital Notes, even on the whiteboard back home, at one time there was a game plan to crack GATE with a <100 rank, later it changed to a plan to spend the 3 month vacation most efficiently. None have worked for me, but maybe thats the thing, thats the content of the dragon scroll, its the accumulation of such pointless acts that lead you and keep you in the right general direction.

I feel like I am smart, at-least everyone in my academic life has led me to believe that, not all of them would be wrong, not everyone would be in on the sick joke... possibly another bit of optimism is that they might be right. But the tragedy of this story is that I could never put it to any good use. The nice brain model comes with a curse, can't be in full control of it. What is control anyway ? I'm referring to my own brain in the third person like its distinguishable form me, while it and I are the same entity. Coming back to the tragedy at hand, this issue of not having the control over my mind is not new, I have not only recognized and acknowledged it but also resigned myself to it, several times. Those moments we undoubtedly the worst times in my life, and I've had a pretty good and comfortable life, maybe thats the issue... but thats a thought for another time.

Maybe its some kind of bias, the felling of being better than average but ending up not performing to the mark, that sounds to me like the person pretty average. Anyways I don't want to waste my life, I don't want to live in the dark not knowing what could have been. 33% of my life is gone, I'll be 25 soon, its about time I get a hold on myself.

#### My Biggest Flaws

- Cant be consistent / lacks discipline.
- Lack of Focus
- Addiction and loss of control over myself, cant stop scrolling / watching shit / eating junk.
- Cant fully commit to something, can't finish it. I tend to give up by the end of something and that has truly hurt me in so many ways.
- Overflowing Interest Queue (things I need to do to make myself better)

Now lets come up with plans to deal with them using habits. I believe any skill is learnable, and I hope that the states(chemical composition) of the brain that stop us from doing the needful things is not dependent on physiology (in simple words, anyone could do it)

For the first one, I have decided to run 10km every Sunday, and till now I have missed it twice, once I just ran 5km and the other time I didn't sleep, so it was all the more troubling to wake up. I don't intend to stop, using this habit I intend to add to the list more things that I would like to do for building consistency and a better routine.
- Run every Sunday
- Sit on the Chair

### Interests
The above depressing things aside, let's try to find the thing that I actually want to do for the rest of my life, SDE is a general ass role. I got an offer from Experian, I'm not going to be here for a long time. I want to do things that I find interesting. These are the fronts I plan to explore before I start my job.
- System Architecture (DDIA)
- Compilers
- Distributed Systems
