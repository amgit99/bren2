Scale Invariant Feature Transform is finding points of interest to do pattern matching and 2D object detection. Applications are detecting blobs, point etc.
We also need some sort of background information to match points, these are called SIFT Descriptors.

Matching feature points become easier when the scale, orientation lighting becomes similar.
