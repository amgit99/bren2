1. Rust(Actix) of GoLang(Gorilla, echo) backends, NodeJS also used for that, an alternative is NEXTjs, we will create NEXTjs backend routes(not Express)

3. Server-side Rendered Components, Client-side Rendered Components, Router

11. Monitoring : Prometheus (Request code logs, how many 200s, 400s, 500s), set alerts on thresholds.
