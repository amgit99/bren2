## Lecture 3 - Grammars

All finite state machine defines a right/left linear grammar, they are <span style="color:#e1db3d">always regular</span>.
If a language is generated by a right linear grammar then the same language can be generated by a life linear grammar, and vice versa.![[Pasted image 20240212140136.png]]
<aside> 💡 <span style="color:#e1db3d">Catenation</span> is the real word, but concatenation won out, con just means “with” and catenation means joining to form a chain

<span style="color:#e1db3d">Context-free</span> : The left hand side of the production only has one non-terminal symbol.
<span style="color:#e1db3d">Context-sensitive</span> : The left hand side can have a combination of terminals and non-terminals.

There are no linear time algorithms available for parsing context sensitive languages. It must be context free for linear time parsing.
