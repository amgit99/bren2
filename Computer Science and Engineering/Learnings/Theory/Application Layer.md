## DNS : :
The need for a [[DNS]] domain name system (an application layer system) is for people to have nice <span style="color:#e1db3d">readable names</span> so that they can remember the addresses of websites. Its also used as an <span style="color:#e1db3d">indirection</span>, this lets multiple servers(machines) operate under same name/interchange machines, which would not be the case for a fixed IP address, as it is unique to a machine.
It also has huge implications in user privacy.
