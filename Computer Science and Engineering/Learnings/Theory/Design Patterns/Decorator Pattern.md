This is an interesting one, the use case is very common. Any food ordering application or restaurant that has some sort of <span style="color:#e1db3d">base food</span> and <span style="color:#e1db3d">toppings/condiments/add-ons</span>. A real world example is a food ordering application, we select the base food and to it we add toppings, in case of pizza, or caramel/whipped cream in case of coffee at fancy shops. The cost depends on these add ons, and so does the description of the order. This patterns supports a structure that makes a design as such very easy to implement.![[Pasted image 20240217133845.png]]Here, we see an interesting relationship, the DataSource interface acts as the template for both the base object and its decorators, this is because, a base object wrapped with any number of <span style="color:#e1db3d">decorators should behave like the base object too</span>. This is why both should share some common interface. There is another crucial arrow, the <span style="color:#e1db3d">has-a arrow</span>, this forms the chained/layered model, where every Decorator has a reference to the object one layer below, so it could call on its methods while recursively calculating something all the way down to the core(i.e. base object).
