<span style="color:#e1db3d">The Problem</span>: We have two things and one of these things changes its state. It may have multiple states. The other thing for some reason needs to know whenever the other thing changes its state. The second objects can be called as a subscriber, and needs the updates.
So this patterns is essentially moving from a <span style="color:#e1db3d">poll</span> to a <span style="color:#e1db3d">push</span> strategy. We know polling has its downsides, in terms of overhead and inaccuracy stemming from the polling rate (not instantaneous, will get updated at next poll). 
We shall call these two objects, the <span style="color:#e1db3d">observable</span> and the <span style="color:#e1db3d">observers</span>. Now there can be many instances of each of them, essentially having a many to many relationship. So now we state that it is the job of the observable to update all its observers, and the way to keep track of the observers is to have them subscribe to the observable. Now, anytime a state change occurs, the observable pushes the changes to the observer.![[Screenshot 2023-12-19 at 10.14.50 PM.png]]
