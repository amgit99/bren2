Events as the name suggests are for communication in a Publisher Subscriber paradigm.

<span style="color:#e1db3d">Example</span>: In a video encoding application, once the encoding is completed, a notification is sent to via mail to the user. If we want to add the functionality that the user is notified via text message as well, then we must make the changes to the encoder function where we add the function invocation for the text notification. This involves recompiling the encoder assembly and substituting it in production code. Instead for such features we could create an event which is triggered when the encoding service is complete (publisher) and the email notification service (subscriber) performs its job. In this design we may add more subscribers (text message service) that subscribe to this event without making changes to the original code.
